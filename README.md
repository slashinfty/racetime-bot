# racetime-bot
A Node.js library to help you create chat bots for racetime.gg 

## Purpose

The racetime application allows categories to set up their own bots, which can interact with ongoing races in order to supply information and similar actions.

This library provides a basic template for creating these bots.

## Setup

#### Requirements

* Node >= 17.5

#### Installation

Via NPM: `npx racetime-bot`

## Getting Started

You should read the racetime-app documentation on [Category bots](https://github.com/racetimeGG/racetime-app/wiki/Category-bots) to understand what you need to get started. You don't need a thorough understanding of the technical side of things to build your own bot, but it is helpful to be able to understand how messages are structured, and how they are used.
